# World Life Expectancy Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in SQL

## Overview
This project explores global life expectancy trends using SQL. The dataset contains life expectancy data by country and year, along with economic indicators such as GDP. The goal is to uncover insights into factors affecting life expectancy and analyze trends over time.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes:
- Country
- Year
- Life expectancy
- GDP
- Additional health and economic indicators

## Objectives
- Examine life expectancy trends over time.
- Analyze the impact of GDP on life expectancy.
- Identify countries with the highest and lowest improvements in life expectancy.
- Explore correlations between economic development and longevity.

## Process
### Data Exploration:
- Retrieved dataset details.
- Examined data distribution and missing values.

### Trend Analysis:
- Aggregated life expectancy data by year.
- Identified patterns in life expectancy changes.

### Economic Influence Analysis:
- Evaluated the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
- Compared life expectancy in high-GDP vs. low-GDP countries.

### Country-Specific Insights:
- Identified countries with the highest and lowest life expectancy.
- Measured improvements in life expectancy over 15 years.

### Impact of GDP:
- Countries with higher GDP tend to have higher life expectancy.
- High-GDP countries show a more consistent increase in life expectancy.
- Low-GDP countries experience greater fluctuations and lower life expectancy.

### Country-Specific Insights:
- Certain countries saw over a 10-year increase in life expectancy within 15 years.
- The gap between the highest and lowest life expectancy countries has narrowed over time.

## SQL Queries Used
The analysis was conducted using various SQL queries, including:
- Aggregating life expectancy over time.
- Comparing GDP and life expectancy correlations.
- Identifying top and bottom countries in life expectancy improvements.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Database Management System:** SQL

## Key Findings
### Life Expectancy Trends:
- Global life expectancy has generally increased over the years.
- Some countries experienced significant improvements, while others lagged.

## Conclusion
This exploratory data analysis highlights the strong correlation between GDP and life expectancy. While global life expectancy has improved, economic disparities still impact health outcomes. Future studies could incorporate additional factors like healthcare access, education, and public health policies to refine insights.
